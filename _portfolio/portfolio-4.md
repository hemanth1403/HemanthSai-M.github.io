# HandGestureMouseOperations

This is my first computer vision project

This project is mainly focused on mouse operations

We can perform multiple mouse operations such as mouse click operation i.e Left click, drag-drop and even volume controls

1. Initially mouse can be controlled by using your index finger and keeping all the other fingers closed.
2. To perform a mouse click operation initially you have to uncomment the 69th line in the AiVirtualMouseProject.py and to click you have to use only your middle and index finger and keep the rest of the fingers closed
3. To perform volume operation you need to open your thumb and the index finger and keep all the other fingers closed, Now the distance between your thumb and the index finger determines the volume of your computer. The lesser the distance between your thumb and index finger, the lesser the volume and the greater the distance between them the higher the volume of your computer.
