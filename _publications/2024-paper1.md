Paper talks about the implmentation of modernizes visitor management in technical laboratories by replacing the traditional paper-based registry with a machine learning and computer vision system for face recognition. The proposed solution involves a robot that captures and enhances visitor images, detects individuals, and extracts facial features (encodings) which are stored in a JSON format. Using SVM (Support Vector Machine), the system compares new visitor face embeddings against the stored data for identification. Upon recognizing a visitor, it measures their temperature and provides a voice command with their status. This approach aims to streamline the visitor tracking process, enhance security, and reduce manual workload.
