The Intelligent Vehicle Safety System with Drunk Driving and Abuse Detectors is an innovative solution that prioritizes road safety and passenger well-being. By leveraging advanced technologies such as integrated sensors, image processing, and machine learning algorithms, the system effectively detects and addresses drunk driving and abuse within vehicles. With real-time alerts and interventions, it enhances passenger security and creates a safer driving environment. The system utilizes alcohol level sensors to automatically disable the vehicle's ignition when alcohol concentration exceeds a set limit, preventing drunk driving. It also incorporates audio and video monitoring systems to detect abuse immediately, generating alerts and contacting authorities when necessary. By proactively preventing drunk driving and swiftly addressing abuse, this system ensures vehicle occupants' well-being and sets a high standard for intelligent vehicle safety.
