Agricultural development is a vital form of income and a major part of Indian economic growth is dependent on crop cultivation. The proposed invention integrates machine learning and Internet of Things concepts for detecting diseases in the rice plant. The IoT technology solutions facilitate remote tracking of the agricultural sector's knowledge from the landscape. Temperature, air pressure, water level, and level of sunshine are tracked and transmitted to the cloud. From the residence, the farm workers will track the plantation's sustainability records. A Machine Learning model that incorporates the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to diagnose rice plant diseases leveraging the photos and including the necessary treatment. The treatments include accurate details concerning the utilization of fertilizer or fungicide to treat the illness.
