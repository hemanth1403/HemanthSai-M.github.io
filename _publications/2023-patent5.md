In the proposed invention, artificial intelligence (AI), a unique machine learning method is used for automatically identifying the different bird species from their photos. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to categorize the different bird species using a dataset for training and forecasting. The proposed method can quickly determine the species of any bird. The endangered species can be separated to take necessary precautions to ensure their existence.
