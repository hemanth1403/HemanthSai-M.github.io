Road safety has always been a major developmental and public health concern in a highly populated country like India. It is paramount for saving millions of lives. Though the improvisation and facilitation of a better road and safety infrastructure is somehow in the hands of the government, but safety measures at the grass root levels always begin with an individual. According to World Health Organization in 2021 at least one of 10 people killed on roads across the world is from India. Road accidents cost the economy in addition to the victims and their families. Although the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken numerous steps, such as those pertaining to vehicle and road engineering as well as educational measures for boosting awareness in the field of road safety, the number of accidents has not decreased. In addition, Driver Assistant Robot is used to improve this experience. The proposed robot helps the government and the humans to decrease the number of accidents and to make the task of the person easier by the navigation system, monitoring the actions of the driver it warns or alerts if the driver is intoxicated, smoking in the car, or drowsy while driving. The driver can also start a conversation or use speech to control the music system and could send or receive SOS messages in an emergency. In the future, this robot aids in reducing accidents and boosting the economy.
